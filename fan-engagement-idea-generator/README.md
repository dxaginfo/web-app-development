# Fan Engagement Idea Generator

## App Concept Overview
The Fan Engagement Idea Generator is a brainstorming tool designed to help sports teams and brands develop innovative ways to engage their fans beyond their core product or service. By inputting basic parameters about their business and audience, users receive tailored fan engagement suggestions that can be implemented across various platforms and contexts.

## MVP Features
1. **Input Form** - Collects key information:
   - Type of product/service (e.g., sports team, entertainment brand)
   - Target audience demographics
   - Budget range
   - Current engagement channels

2. **Idea Generation Engine** - Processes inputs to generate relevant engagement ideas:
   - Pre-populated database of engagement strategies
   - Categorization system (AR experiences, contests, community events, etc.)
   - Filtering mechanism based on input parameters

3. **Results Display** - Presents ideas in an organized, actionable format:
   - Category-based grouping
   - Brief description of each idea
   - Implementation difficulty rating
   - Budget estimate
   - Potential engagement metrics

## Architecture Design

### Frontend Components
1. **User Input Form**
   - React-based interface with form validation
   - Dynamic fields based on product/service type
   - Visual slider for budget range

2. **Results Dashboard**
   - Card-based layout for idea presentation
   - Filtering and sorting options
   - Save/export functionality

### Backend Components
1. **Ideas Database**
   - JSON structure with categorized engagement concepts
   - Tagging system for filtering
   - Metadata for difficulty, budget requirements, etc.

2. **Matching Algorithm**
   - Rule-based system to match inputs with appropriate ideas
   - Weighting mechanism for relevance scoring
   - Randomization factor to ensure variety

## Implementation Approach

The core of this application is a database of pre-populated fan engagement ideas, structured to support filtering and matching based on user inputs. The implementation uses React for the frontend and a simple JSON-based data store for the ideas database.

### Sample Database Entry
```json
{
  "id": "idea-001",
  "title": "AR Team Mascot Hunt",
  "category": "AR Experience",
  "description": "A location-based augmented reality game where fans hunt for virtual versions of team mascots around the venue or city.",
  "implementationSteps": [
    "Create 3D models of mascot",
    "Develop AR application or partner with existing AR platform",
    "Map virtual mascot locations",
    "Design reward system for completed hunts"
  ],
  "budgetRange": {
    "min": 5000,
    "max": 25000,
    "currency": "USD"
  },
  "difficultyLevel": 3,
  "timeToImplement": "4-8 weeks",
  "targetAudiences": ["families", "tech-savvy fans", "casual fans"],
  "potentialMetrics": ["app downloads", "hunt completions", "social shares"],
  "exampleBrands": ["Orlando Magic", "Pokemon Go partnership"]
}
```

### Key Components

1. **Input Form**: Collects user requirements through a multi-step form with validation
2. **Matching Algorithm**: Filters and ranks ideas based on relevance to user inputs
3. **Results Display**: Presents filtered ideas in a visually appealing, card-based layout
4. **Filtering System**: Allows users to further refine results based on category, budget, and difficulty

## Implementation Details

### Input Form Component (InputForm.js)
The form component collects user information including:
- Product/service type (dropdown)
- Target audience (checkboxes)
- Budget range (slider)

### Matching Algorithm (matchingAlgorithm.js)
The algorithm filters and ranks ideas based on:
1. Budget compatibility
2. Target audience overlap
3. Relevance scoring with weighted factors
4. Randomization element for variety

### Results Component (IdeasDisplay.js)
Displays filtered ideas with:
- Category filters
- Budget filters
- Difficulty level filters
- Card-based layout

### Database Structure (mockDatabase.js)
Contains 10 pre-populated fan engagement ideas across categories:
- AR/VR experiences
- Digital content
- Community events
- Contests
- In-venue experiences

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v14.0.0 or higher)
- npm or yarn

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
